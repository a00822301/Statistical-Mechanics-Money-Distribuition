# Statistical-Mechanics-Money-Distribuition
The project consists in finding through a numerical analyis, the evolution of two proposed objective functions that describe the distribution of money in a society.
This was achieved by simulating transactions of money between the agents of a society.
In this model, both total amount of money and number of agents were conserved.
After defining the initial distribution of money, number of clases, and the logical restrictions, the interactions were left to evolve randomly and free. 
The obtained distributions were then analyzed by entropy and how the proposed objective functions would look like. 
This project was made individually, following the professor's guidelines, and comparing results to my classmates.
